Arithmetic Operators: + - / *
Bitwise Operators (Base 2 number system):

1) << : Bitshift Left
2) >> : Bitshift Right
3) && : AND Operator
4) || : OR Operator
5)  ^ : XOR Operator
6)  ~ : NOT Operator

You can definitely overload/override these operators. ["bitshifts" => "cout"]
In our computers: We have capacitors where below a certain threshold of current, it falls into OFF state, otherwise ON state.
This is how our RAM stores data. Binary system uses 0,1 numbers.
Five is 101. Int is 4 bytes.
