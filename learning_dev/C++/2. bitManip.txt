Prerequisite Knowledge: Bits and Bitwise Operators, Decimal to Binary conversion

Concept 1: To get Bit
Suppose to get a bit at position i = 2.
n =         0 1 0 1        = 5
Pos/Index:  3 2 1 0

First form a number where only the target position has 1.
In our case: 1 << i = 0 1 0 0 using left-shift operator.

Then take the & Operator of New number and Original number
0101 & 0100 = 0100
Doing this lets us know the value of the target position. As rest all numbers are 0.
Finally, check if(n & (1 << i) != 0), then bit is 1.

Second case: Set bit
Suppose to set the bit at position i, and make it 1.
n = 0 1 0 1
1 << i = 0010 (here, for the first position, the value of i = 1)
Then take the OR function as if its a 0, it'll stay a 0 cuz only 1 position has 1 according to 
our variable that we are using. Otherwise 1 OR outputs a 1, which would still leave it unchanged.

Ex. 0101 | 0010 = 0111
