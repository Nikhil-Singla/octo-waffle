Prerequisite Knowledge: Bits and Bitwise Operators, Decimal to Binary conversion

Concept 1: To get Bit
Suppose to get a bit at position i = 2.
n =         0 1 0 1        = 5
Pos/Index:  3 2 1 0

First form a number where only the target position has 1.
In our case: 1 << i = 0 1 0 0 using left-shift operator.

Then take the & Operator of New number and Original number
0101 & 0100 = 0100
Doing this lets us know the value of the target position. As rest all numbers are 0.
Finally, check if(n & (1 << i) != 0), then bit is 1.

Second case: Set bit
